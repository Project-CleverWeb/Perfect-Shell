# Perfect-Shell (codename: P-Shell) #

**Site :** [projectcleverweb.com](http://projectcleverweb.com)  
**Description :**  
The idea is to create a day-to-day shell that is easy to read, cross OS compatible/consistent, and has git integration. Right now this only supports most linux bash prompts (and possibly Mac, idk I dont normally use Mac, but i know Mac & Linux are very closely related). Windows version may be available withing a couple days/weeks.

##Updates##
Most informational aspects (such us the codex or this readme) will be updated as full versions are released. Requests for ETA's on versions or update will be ignored entirely.  

##Screen Shots##
- Coming Soon  

##Installation##
**Requirements**  
- [Insatll Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) and make sure it's added to your $path (you may need to google how to do this for your OS)  

**Linux/Mac** (Recommended)  
- Make sure that you have hidden file showing (try *ctrl + H*/*cmd + H*)
- Add .bashrc to to your */home* directory (e.g. */home/your_name*). If the file already exists, open it in a text editor and add the contents of the new *.bashrc* to the old *.bashrc* (replacing the file should not break anything, but better safe than sorry).  
- If you want to make this effect all users and not just yourself, **ONLY** add the contents the *.bashrc* file to the bottom of */etc/bash.bashrc*. The file may have a simular name and not *bash.bashrc*, however experiance says it should be *bash.bashrc*  
- Reopen any bash/terminal windows to see the effect.  

**Linux/Mac (root user)**  
- Coming Soon  

**Windows**  
- Coming Soon
